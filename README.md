## Technology Involved
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript

## How it Works

- The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

- Wins are the number of times the user has guessed the letter correctly

- Losses are the number of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses

- The number of guesses left are set to 9

- "Guesses So Far" are the specific letters that the user typed. These are displayed until the user either wins or loses.

- When the player wins, it increases the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

- When the player loses, it increases the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
